# CRAFT shared task evaluation
This repository hosts code and scripts used for evaluation of the [CRAFT Shared Tasks 2019](https://sites.google.com/view/craft-shared-task-2019/home).

There are three ways one might use the code/scripts in this repository: 

1. By far, the easiest way is to use the pre-built Docker container. The Docker container contains all dependencies for the evaluation scripts, the evaluation scripts themselves, and the CRAFT corpus. It is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ucdenverccp/craft-eval), and instructions for how to use it are available on the [Evaluation via Docker](https://github.com/UCDenver-ccp/craft-shared-tasks/wiki/Evaluation-via-Docker-(Recommended-Method)) wiki page.
2. The next easiest way to evaluate your files against CRAFT is to build the Docker container yourself. Instructions for building the Docker container can be found on the [Building the CRAFT ST evaluation Docker container](https://github.com/UCDenver-ccp/craft-shared-tasks/wiki/Building-the-CRAFT-evaluation-Docker-container) wiki page.
3. Finally, the third option is to download [the latest stable release of this repository](https://github.com/UCDenver-ccp/craft-shared-tasks/releases), install any missing dependencies, and to run the evaluations in your local environment. **NOTE, this is not the recommended approach,** but instructions for a local installation are available on the [Local installation](https://github.com/UCDenver-ccp/craft-shared-tasks/wiki/Evaluation-via-Local-Installation) wiki page.
